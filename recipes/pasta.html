    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz (225g) pasta of your choice (such as spaghetti, penne, or fettuccine)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, chopped, for garnish</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving some pasta water.                                </li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and chopped onion, saut√©ing until softened and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juices, along with dried oregano, dried basil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if using. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
        <li>Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the sauce and finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed, adding more salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Once ready, transfer the pasta to serving plates or a large serving dish.</li>
        <li>Garnish with freshly chopped basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, accompanied by extra Parmesan cheese on the side for sprinkling, and enjoy the deliciousness of your homemade pasta dish!</li>
