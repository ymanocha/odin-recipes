        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes, then cut them into evenly-sized fries, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>    
        <li>Place the cut fries in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours, to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked fries and pat them dry thoroughly with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.                                                                    </li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 325째F (160째C). </li>
        <li>Carefully add the dried fries to the hot oil in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the fryer or pot.</li>
        <li>Fry the potatoes for about 3-4 minutes, or until they are just beginning to soften but have not yet developed color.</li>
        <li>Remove the partially cooked fries from the oil and place them on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Increase the temperature of the oil to 375째F (190째C).</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, return the partially cooked fries to the fryer or pot in batches and fry them again until they turn golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>As the fries finish cooking, transfer them to a clean wire rack or paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>While the fries are still hot, season them generously with salt and any additional seasonings of your choice, such as paprika, garlic powder, or black pepper.</li>
        <li>Toss the fries gently to evenly distribute the seasonings.</li>
        <li>Serve the French fries hot and crispy alongside your favorite dipping sauces, and enjoy the irresistible crunch and flavor!</li>
    </ol>
